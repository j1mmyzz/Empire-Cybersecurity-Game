        It's great that you chose to have a VPN. However, not all VPNs are safe
        and trustworthy. It's up to you do so some research on which VPN is
        safe.
      </p>
      <p>Here are two examples</p>
      <div class="side-by-side-images">
        <img src="images/NordVPN.png" alt="nord VPN" />
        <img src="images/hotspotsheild.png" alt="hotspot sheild VPN" />
      </div>
      <p>
        With a quick search, you can see that Hotspot Sheild is untrustworthy as
        it was accused of keylogging before.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="keylogging">Keylogging:</span> is the practice of covertly
        recording input signals into a computer from a keyboard. This means that
        a hacker can see what you type and this would be bad if you were using a
        bad VPN connected to your network.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this case, the safe option would be to choose NordVPN. It has a good
        history and millions of active users.
